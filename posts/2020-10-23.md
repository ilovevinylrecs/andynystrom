<p>Everyone's favorite obscuro record label <a href="http://www.numerogroup.com/" target="_blank">Numero Group</a> put together their Halloween playlist and as expected it's chock full of songs you've probably never heard before. It's a great listen, and would be the coolest Halloween comp with the Frankenstein's dancing cover art.  Halloween is my favorite time of the year, so I put together my list of top Halloween jams to listen to at your socially-distanced prob home alone dance party.
